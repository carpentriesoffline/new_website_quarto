# About CarpentriesOffline

CarpentriesOffline was born out of the Software Sustainability Instituteâ€™s 2021 Collababorations Workshop. The idea was formed by a team during the Collaborative Ideas session, and the implementation began on the Hack Day. Our aim was to find a solution to the challenges presented when trying to run workshops with limited or no Internet access.
