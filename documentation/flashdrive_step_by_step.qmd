1. You will need a 4GB flashdrive to start with 
1. Download Slax Linux. If you have a 32bit computer you will need the 32bit version which you can download with this link: <a href="https://slax.org/download-slax.php?a=32bit&b=Debian">https://slax.org/download-slax.php?a=32bit&b=Debian</a>. If you have a 64 bit computer, download Slax with this link: <a href="https://slax.org/download-slax.php?a=64bit&b=Debian">https://slax.org/download-slax.php?a=64bit&b=Debian</a>
1. - The file you just downloaded is an ISO image which you can mount on your computer as a virtual disk. (Instructions to mount of the three main operating systems will follow soon).

   - To mount on Linux, assuming you are in the same directory as where you download the iso to.
   - `sudo mount -o loop ./slax-##bit-#.#.#.iso `
   - where the #s are replaced by the actual numbers in the name of the file you downloaded.
