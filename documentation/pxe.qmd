## What is PXE Boot?

*In computing, the* ***Preboot eXecution Environment*** *specification describes a standardised clientâ€“server environment that boots a software assembly, retrieved from a network, on PXE-enabled clients. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment))*

## List of ToDos

- [ ] Write the Raspberry Pi OS image to an SD card.
- [ ] Run and update and an upgrade.
- [ ] Install and configure DNS masquerade.
- [ ] Install and configure Network File System.
- [ ] Download and install PXE scripts: `git clone https://github.com/carpentriesoffline/pxe-boot.git`

## Step 1
Rather than duplicating instructions that might change, we'd rather link to the Raspberry Pi website where you can download the Raspberry Pi imager from and also find the instruction for writing an image to an SD card. The most important thing to remember is to select the **Raspberry Pi OS Lite** image because you don't want to unneccessarily install a graphics environment which only takes up space on the installation disk and make things slower. The link to the web page is [https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).

## Step 2

In a bash terminal do the following:

```bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt full-upgrade -y
```

### Step 3

Install dnsmasq and nfs (Network file system):
```bash
sudo apt install dnsmasq nfs-kernel nfs-common
```

### Step 4

Configure DNS masquerading and NFS.

To configure DNS masquerading edit the file `/etc/dnsmasq.conf` as follows:
```
port=0
bind-dynamic
interface=eth0
domain-needed
bogus-priv
enable-tftp
tftp-root=/pxe-boot
pxe-service=0,"Raspberry Pi Boot"
dhcp-option=3,192.168.5.100
dhcp-option=6,10.3.141.1
dhcp-range=eth0,192.168.5.101,192.168.5.200,12h
dhcp-host=a1:a1:a1:a1:a1:a1,192.168.5.101
dhcp-host=a2:a2:a2:a2:a2:a2,192.168.5.102
dhcp-host=a3:a3:a3:a3:a3:a3,192.168.5.103
dhcp-host=a4:a4:a4:a4:a4:a4,192.168.5.104
dhcp-host=a5:a5:a5:a5:a5:a5,192.168.5.105
dhcp-host=a6:a6:a6:a6:a6:a6,192.168.5.106
```
